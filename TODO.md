1. **Environment setup** - Consider adding a `.env.example` file to demonstrate environment variable management
2. **Documentation** - Add a `docs/` directory with basic Sphinx or MkDocs configuration for generating documentation
3. **CI/CD** - Include a basic GitHub Actions or similar CI workflow file for running tests and linting
4. **Pre-commit hooks** - Add a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to enforce code quality checks before commits
6. **Changelog** - Include a `CHANGELOG.md` to track version changes
7. **Docker** - Add a simple `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerization
8. **Code coverage** - Add configuration for a coverage tool like `coverage.py`
9. **Benchmarking** - Maybe include a simple benchmarking utility using something like `pytest-benchmark`
10. **Examples directory** - Create an `examples/` folder with more usage examples
